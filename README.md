# Challenge 2

A production-ready system for **automated testing, evaluation, and self-improvement of debt collection voice agents**. Generate diverse customer personas, simulate complex real-world conversations, track key voicebot metrics, and iteratively optimize your agent ‚Äî all with one platform.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Persona Generation:** Create 50+ realistic debtor personalities with diverse traits, stress levels, and payment histories.
- **Conversation Simulation:** Run multi-turn, scenario-specific debt collection call simulations automatically.
- **Comprehensive Metrics:** Evaluate agents using Repetition, Negotiation, Relevance, Compliance, Empathy, Resolution Rate, Satisfaction, and Overall Score.
- **Self-Correcting System:** Pinpoint weaknesses, auto-improve prompts, and repeat until you hit your target score‚Äîall hands-free.
- **Intuitive Web App:** Use a Streamlit dashboard to generate personas, test & optimize your agent, and visualize results.
- **Extensible:** Modular Python design, easy to adapt for other industries or integrate with voice APIs.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Generate Diverse Personas**: Automatically create customers with realistic psychology and debt traits.
2. **Simulate Calls**: Test your voice agent prompt with dozens of personas across 8 real debt scenarios.
3. **Analyze Performance**: Instantly see which personas and situations your agent struggles with.
4. **Self-Improve**: The platform rewrites your prompt based on test results and measures improvement‚Äîno human-in-the-loop needed.
5. **Repeat**: Each iteration gets your agent closer to industry-leading performance and compliance.

## üìä Example Metrics (After Self-Correction)

| Metric               | Before | After  |
|----------------------|--------|--------|
| Overall Score        | 0.56   | 0.78   |
| Negotiation          | 0.51   | 0.73   |
| Compliance           | 0.72   | 0.89   |
| Resolution Rate      | 0.40   | 0.65   |



üõ°Ô∏è Compliance
All conversations and prompts are built for full U.S. debt collection law and privacy compliance (FDCPA, TCPA, with opt-out/cease support).
